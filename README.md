# GitHub Actions Docker Private Registry Authentication Issues

This repository demonstrates authentication issues when using GitHub Actions with Docker actions and private registries. The tests showcase when Docker actions fail unexpectedly and when they succeed for different action types.

## Problem Overview

The problem centers around when private images are being pulled. In certain scenarios, GitHub Actions tries to pull the images early in the process, but ends up doing it before the login has happened, resulting in a 401 Unauthorized error.

## What We're Testing

### ✅ **What Works Consistently**

- **Composite actions** using `docker run` commands
- **Local action calls** after `actions/checkout`
- **Direct Docker commands** in workflow steps

### ❌ **What Fails Unexpectedly**  

- **Docker image actions** (`using: "docker"` with `image: "docker://registry/image"`)
- **Remote action calls** without checkout
- **Dockerfile actions** with private base images (inconsistent behavior)

## Test Scenarios

Each test demonstrates the authentication behavior across three Docker action types:

### 1. **Composite Actions** (`using: "composite"`)

- **Expected**: ✅ Always succeeds
- **Reason**: Uses direct `docker run` commands which respect authentication

### 2. **Dockerfile Actions** (`using: "docker"`, `image: "Dockerfile"`)

- **Remote call**: ❌ Fails (triggers a pull before login step)
- **Local call**: ✅ Succeeds (after `actions/checkout` and login)
- **Reason**: In remote calls, a dynamically added step tries to pull the image before authentication is set up, leading to a 401 Unauthorized error. Local calls work because they run after the login step, which has the necessary authentication.

### 3. **Image Actions** (`using: "docker"`, `image: "docker://registry/image"`)

- **Remote call**: ❌ Fails (same issue as Dockerfile actions)
- **Local call**: ✅ Succeeds (only after pre-pulling image)

## Repository Structure

### Test Reusable Actions

```text
test-gh-docker/
├── composite/          # 🧩 Composite action (always works)
├── dockerfile/         # 🐳 Dockerfile action (works locally)
└── image/             # 📦 Image action (works with workarounds)
```

### Workflows

```text
.github/workflows/
├── orchestrator.yml         # 🎯 Calls other workflows (organized)
├── comprehensive.yml        # 📋 All tests in one file (monolithic)
├── composite.yml            # 🧩 Individual: Composite tests
├── dockerfile.yml           # 🐳 Individual: Dockerfile tests  
├── image.yml                # 📦 Individual: Image Reference tests
└── dind.yml                # 🔄 Individual: Docker-in-Docker tests
```

## Example Results

After running `docker/login-action` to authenticate with a private registry:

```yaml
- uses: docker/login-action@v3
  with:
    registry: private-registry
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

# ❌ This fails
- uses: my-org/my-docker-action@main  # uses: docker, image: docker://private-registry/image

# ✅ This works - Local call with checkout
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: ./my-docker-action            # Same action, called locally

# ✅ This works - Composite action with docker run
- uses: my-org/my-composite-action@main  # uses: composite, runs: docker run private-registry/image
```

## Root Cause

GitHub Actions tries to pull/build actions dynamically, which happens before all other steps (including docker login), leading to a failure when the action attempts to pull a private image without authentication.

## Current Workarounds

1. **Use `actions/checkout` before calling Docker actions locally** (to use either `docker` or `image reference` actions)
2. **Pre-pull images with `docker pull`** for image reference actions
3. **Convert to composite actions using `docker run`** (Best solution currently)
4. **Make images public** (not feasible for enterprise)

## Expected Behavior

Docker authentication should work consistently across all action types (`using: "docker"` and `using: "composite"`).

## Impact

This affects enterprise users with private registries and forces:

- Inefficient workarounds
- Inconsistent action behavior
- Inability to use `using: "docker"` actions with private registries
- Additional complexity in CI/CD pipelines

## Environment

- **Runners**: `ubuntu-latest`
- **Registries**: Tested with ACR, GHCR
- **Authentication**: `docker/login-action@v3`
- **GitHub Token**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: read` permission

## Contributing

To reproduce these issues:

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Push Docker images to your private registry**
3. **Update registry URLs in workflows**
4. **Run the workflows and observe the authentication failures**

The failing tests demonstrate the core issue, while the succeeding tests show the necessary workarounds.
